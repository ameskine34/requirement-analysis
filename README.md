# Requirement Analysis in Software Development :

Requirement analysis helps identify and document what a system should do by gathering, analyzing, and prioritizing stakeholder needs.

The purpose of this repository is to:

Provide learning materials and examples related to requirement analysis.

Demonstrate how requirements are captured, refined, and managed.

Highlight best practices for ensuring software meets business and user needs.

# What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is the process of identifying, gathering, and defining the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system. It is a crucial phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) because it establishes a clear understanding of what the system should accomplish before design and implementation begin.

# Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Requirement Analysis is one of the most critical steps in software development because it directly influences the success of the project. Without it, teams risk building the wrong product or wasting time and resources.

Key Reasons Why It’s Important:

Clarity of Goals – It defines what the software should achieve, avoiding confusion between stakeholders and developers.

Better Planning – Accurate requirements help in estimating cost, time, and resources effectively.

Reduced Risks & Errors – Early detection of missing or conflicting requirements prevents costly mistakes later.

Stakeholder Alignment – Ensures all stakeholders (clients, users, developers, testers, managers) share the same understanding.

Improved Quality – By specifying functional and non-functional requirements, the final product is more likely to meet user needs.

Cost & Time Efficiency – Fixing issues during requirement analysis is far cheaper than fixing them after development.

# Key Activities in Requirement Analysis :

* Requirement Gathering :

Collecting raw requirements from stakeholders (clients, users, managers, domain experts).

Focused on what is needed rather than how to implement it.

* Requirement Elicitation :

Using techniques such as interviews, surveys, brainstorming, workshops, and observation to draw out detailed requirements.

Helps uncover hidden or unclear needs.

* Requirement Documentation : 

Organizing and recording requirements in a structured format.

Commonly done using a Software Requirement Specification (SRS) document, user stories, or use cases.

* Requirement Analysis and Modeling :

Analyzing requirements to resolve conflicts, prioritize them, and check feasibility.

Modeling requirements using diagrams (UML, data flow diagrams, use case diagrams) for better understanding.

* Requirement Validation :

Ensuring requirements are correct, consistent, complete, and testable.

Involves reviews, walkthroughs, and prototyping to confirm that requirements meet stakeholder expectations.
